# Getting Started

It's pretty straightforward to get started with .Net Licensing:

- Create a project in Visual Studio or other IDE, targeting .Net Framework 3.0 or later;
- Add nuget package [DevZest.Licensing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DevZest.Licensing/) to your project.
- Samples are available at [github](https://github.com/DevZest/Licensing.Samples).
